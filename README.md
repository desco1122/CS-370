# Reflection

This project involved constructing a pirate intelligent agent in a virtual world using reinforcement learning and neural networks. We were given the game environment and a basic agent framework, but I had to complete the Q-learning algorithm and implement a neural network to guide the agent's decision-making.

This project served as a bridge between theoretical concepts and practical application. It allowed me to see how the principles of reinforcement learning and neural networks, learned throughout the course, can be utilized to solve real-world problems like pathfinding.

The project also emphasized a systematic problem-solving approach, highlighting the importance of understanding the problem, defining components, implementing solutions, and testing & refining. Additionally, it introduced the ethical responsibilities of computer scientists, such as ensuring model accuracy, mitigating biases, and using technology responsibly to avoid negative impacts.
